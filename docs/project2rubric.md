|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|3|Eveidence in [README.md](https://github.com/21Tulasi/MyDollarBot-newPhase/blob/main/README.md)|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|3|Eveidence in [README.md](https://github.com/21Tulasi/MyDollarBot-newPhase/blob/main/README.md)|
|Use of version control tools|3|[Github](https://github.com/21Tulasi/MyDollarBot-newPhase/tree/main/)|

|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|
|Short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
